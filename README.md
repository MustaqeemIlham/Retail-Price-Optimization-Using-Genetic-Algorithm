# Retail-Price-Optimization-Using-Genetic-Algorithm
A retail price optimization model that uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Polynomial Regression to find the most profitable pricing strategy. The system predicts customer demand based on price, evaluates profit, and evolves optimal prices through GA. This hybrid approach helps retailers make data-driven, adaptive, and competitive pricing decisions.
